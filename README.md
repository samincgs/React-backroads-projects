## Backroads Application

The Backroads Application is a recreation of the HTML/CSS Project I made learning advanced design skills and css concepts from John Smilga's Udemy Course. This projects teaches me how to convert a HTML/CSS project into a React project. It also teaches us how to properly modify data and create easy to understand + reusable components.

Used: Components, Props, ES6 Modules, (Map, Filter, Reduce) Functions

Inspired by John Smilga
